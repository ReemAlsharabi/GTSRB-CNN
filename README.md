## GTSRB-CNN
- Train Loss 0.0958, Train Accuracy 0.9702, Val Loss 0.3132, Val Accuracy 0.9222

## Dataset
- GTSRB: You could download it either from the official GTSRB website, or Kaggle.

- If you're using google colab, then download the dataset as a zipped file and upload it to your google drive.
- If you're using Kaggle, then you don't need to download the dataset.

  Here's a link to the notebook on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/remyhos/gtsrb

## Future work
- I used the traditional CNNs, however, I think using ViT or GRU-based classifier will improve the performance.
